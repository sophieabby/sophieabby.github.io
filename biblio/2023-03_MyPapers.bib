              Marine sediments represent a vast habitat for complex microbiomes. Among these, ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) of the phylum Thaumarchaeota are one of the most common, yet little explored, inhabitants, which seem extraordinarily well adapted to the harsh conditions of the subsurface biosphere. We present 11 metagenome-assembled genomes of the most abundant AOA clades from sediment cores obtained from the Atlantic Mid-Ocean ridge flanks and Pacific abyssal plains. Their phylogenomic placement reveals three independently evolved clades within the order 
              Nitrosopumilales 
              , of which no cultured representative is known yet. In addition to the gene sets for ammonia oxidation and carbon fixation known from other AOA, all genomes encode an extended capacity for the conversion of fermentation products that can be channeled into the central carbon metabolism, as well as uptake of amino acids probably for protein maintenance or as an ammonia source. Two lineages encode an additional (V-type) ATPase and a large repertoire of DNA repair systems that may allow to overcome the challenges of high hydrostatic pressure. We suggest that the adaptive radiation of AOA into marine sediments occurred more than once in evolution and resulted in three distinct lineages with particular adaptations to this extremely energy-limiting and high-pressure environment.},

              Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are widespread in nature and are involved in nitrification, an essential process in the global nitrogen cycle. The enzymes for ammonia oxidation and electron transport rely heavily on copper (Cu), which can be limited in nature. In this study the model soil archaeon 
              Nitrososphaera viennensis 
              was investigated via transcriptomic analysis to gain insight regarding possible Cu uptake mechanisms and compensation strategies when Cu becomes limiting. Upon Cu limitation, 
              N. viennensis 
              exhibited impaired nitrite production and thus growth, which was paralleled by downregulation of ammonia oxidation, electron transport, carbon fixation, nucleotide, and lipid biosynthesis pathway genes. Under Cu-limitation, 1547 out of 3180 detected genes were differentially expressed, with 784 genes upregulated and 763 downregulated. The most highly upregulated genes encoded proteins with a possible role in Cu binding and uptake, such as the Cu chelator and transporter CopC/D, disulfide bond oxidoreductase D ( 
              dsbD 
              ), and multicopper oxidases. While this response differs from the marine strain 
              Nitrosopumilus maritimus 
              , conserved sequence motifs in some of the Cu-responsive genes suggest conserved transcriptional regulation in terrestrial AOA. This study provides possible gene regulation and energy conservation mechanisms linked to Cu bioavailability and presents the first model for Cu uptake by a soil AOA.},

Here, we reconstructed the genomic content and growth temperature of the ancestor of all AOA, as well as the ancestors of the marine and soil lineages, based on 39 available complete or nearly complete genomes of AOA. Our evolutionary scenario depicts an extremely thermophilic, autotrophic, aerobic ancestor from which three independent lineages of a marine and two terrestrial groups radiated into moderate environments. Their emergence was paralleled by (i) a continuous acquisition of an extensive collection of stress tolerance genes mostly involved in redox maintenance and oxygen detoxification, (ii) an expansion of regulatory capacities in transcription and central metabolic functions, and (iii) an extended repertoire of cell appendages and modifications related to adherence and interactions with the environment. Our analysis provides insights into the evolutionary transitions and key processes that enabled the conquest of the diverse environments in which contemporary AOA are found.},

	abstract = {No other environment hosts as many microbial cells as the marine sedimentary biosphere. While the majority of these cells are expected to be alive, they are speculated to be persisting in a state of maintenance without net growth due to extreme starvation. Here, we report evidence for in situ growth of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria in ∼80,000-y-old subsurface sediments from the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. The growth is confined to the nitrate–ammonium transition zone (NATZ), a widespread geochemical transition zone where most of the upward ammonium flux from deep anoxic sediments is being consumed. In this zone the anammox bacteria abundances, assessed by quantification of marker genes, consistently displayed a four order of magnitude increase relative to adjacent layers in four cores. This subsurface cell increase coincides with a markedly higher power supply driven mainly by intensified anammox reaction rates, thereby providing a quantitative link between microbial proliferation and energy availability. The reconstructed draft genome of the dominant anammox bacterium showed an index of replication (iRep) of 1.32, suggesting that 32\% of this population was actively replicating. The genome belongs to a 
              Scalindua

              Candidatus Scalindua sediminis

            ABSTRACT 
             
              Most bacteria can generate ATP by respiratory metabolism, in which electrons are shuttled from reduced substrates to terminal electron acceptors, via quinone molecules like ubiquinone. Dioxygen (O 
              2 
              ) is the terminal electron acceptor of aerobic respiration and serves as a co-substrate in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. Here, we characterize a novel, O 
              2 
              -independent pathway for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. This pathway relies on three proteins, UbiT (YhbT), UbiU (YhbU), and UbiV (YhbV). UbiT contains an SCP2 lipid-binding domain and is likely an accessory factor of the biosynthetic pathway, while UbiU and UbiV (UbiU-UbiV) are involved in hydroxylation reactions and represent a novel class of O 
              2 
              -independent hydroxylases. We demonstrate that UbiU-UbiV form a heterodimer, wherein each protein binds a 4Fe-4S cluster via conserved cysteines that are essential for activity. The UbiT, -U, and -V proteins are found in alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacterial clades, including several human pathogens, supporting the widespread distribution of a previously unrecognized capacity to synthesize ubiquinone in the absence of O 
              2 
              . Together, the O 
              2 
              -dependent and O 
              2 
              -independent ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways contribute to optimizing bacterial metabolism over the entire O 
              2 
              range.

	abstract = {Processes of molecular innovation require tinkering and shifting in the function of existing genes. How this occurs in terms of molecular evolution at long evolutionary scales remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse the natural history of a vast group of membrane-associated molecular systems in Bacteria and Archaea—the type IV filament (TFF) superfamily—that diversified in systems involved in flagellar or twitching motility, adhesion, protein secretion, and DNA uptake. The phylogeny of the thousands of detected systems suggests they may have been present in the last universal common ancestor. From there, two lineages—a bacterial and an archaeal—diversified by multiple gene duplications, gene fissions and deletions, and accretion of novel components. Surprisingly, we find that the ‘tight adherence’ (Tad) systems originated from the interkingdom transfer from Archaea to Bacteria of a system resembling the ‘EppA-dependent’ (Epd) pilus and were associated with the acquisition of a secretin. The phylogeny and content of ancestral systems suggest that initial bacterial pili were engaged in cell motility and/or DNA uptake. In contrast, specialised protein secretion systems arose several times independently and much later in natural history. The functional diversification of the TFF superfamily was accompanied by genetic rearrangements with implications for genetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer: systems encoded in fewer loci were more frequently exchanged between taxa. This may have contributed to their rapid evolution and spread across Bacteria and Archaea. Hence, the evolutionary history of the superfamily reveals an impressive catalogue of molecular evolution mechanisms that resulted in remarkable functional innovation and specialisation from a relatively small set of components.},

              Background 
              To understand the evolutionary role of Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT), accurate methods are needed to identify transferred genes and infer their timing of acquisition. Phylogenetic methods are particularly promising for this purpose, but the reconciliation of a gene tree with a reference (species) tree is computationally hard. In addition, the application of these methods to real data raises the problem of sorting out real and artifactual phylogenetic conflict. 
             
             
              Results 
              We present Prunier, a new method for phylogenetic detection of LGT based on the search for a maximum statistical agreement forest (MSAF) between a gene tree and a reference tree. The program is flexible as it can use any definition of "agreement" among trees. We evaluate the performance of Prunier and two other programs (EEEP and RIATA-HGT) for their ability to detect transferred genes in realistic simulations where gene trees are reconstructed from sequences. Prunier proposes a single scenario that compares to the other methods in terms of sensitivity, but shows higher specificity. We show that LGT scenarios carry a strong signal about the position of the root of the species tree and could be used to identify the direction of evolutionary time on the species tree. We use Prunier on a biological dataset of 23 universal proteins and discuss their suitability for inferring the tree of life. 
             
             
              Conclusions 
              The ability of Prunier to take into account branch support in the process of reconciliation allows a gain in complexity, in comparison to EEEP, and in accuracy in comparison to RIATA-HGT. Prunier's greedy algorithm proposes a single scenario of LGT for a gene family, but its quality always compares to the best solutions provided by the other algorithms. When the root position is uncertain in the species tree, Prunier is able to infer a scenario per root at a limited additional computational cost and can easily run on large datasets. 
               
                Prunier is implemented in C++, using the Bio++ library and the phylogeny program Treefinder. It is available at:

We hereby present a major release of MacSyFinder (Macromolecular System Finder), MacSyFinder version 2 (v2). This new version is coded in Python 3 ({\textgreater}= 3.7). The code was improved and rationalized to facilitate future maintainability. Several new features were added to allow more flexible modelling of the systems. We introduce a more intuitive and comprehensive search engine to identify all the best candidate systems and sub-optimal ones that respect the models’ constraints. We also introduce the novel

            Protein secretion systems are complex molecular machineries that translocate proteins through the outer membrane and sometimes through multiple other barriers. They have evolved by co-option of components from other envelope-associated cellular machineries, making them sometimes difficult to identify and discriminate. Here, we describe how to identify protein secretion systems in bacterial genomes using the MacSyFinder program. This flexible computational tool uses the knowledge gathered from experimental studies to identify homologous systems in genome data. It can be used with a set of pre-defined MacSyFinder models—”TXSScan”, to identify all major secretion systems of diderm bacteria (
            i
            .
            e
            ., with inner and LPS-containing outer membranes) as well as evolutionarily related cell appendages (pili and flagella). For this, it identifies and clusters co-localized genes encoding proteins of secretion systems using sequence similarity search with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) protein profiles. Finally, it checks if the clusters’ genetic content and genomic organization satisfy the constraints of the model. TXSScan models can be altered in the command line or customized to search for variants of known secretion systems. Models can also be built from scratch to identify novel systems. In this chapter, we describe a complete pipeline of analysis, starting from i) the integration of information from a reference set of experimentally studied systems, ii) the identification of conserved proteins and the construction of their HMM protein profiles, iii) the definition and optimization of “macsy-models”, and iv) their use and online distribution as tools to search genomic data for secretion systems of interest.

UQ has important roles, notably in respiratory metabolisms which sustain cellular bioenergetics. Most steps of UQ biosynthesis take place in the cytosol of E. coli within a multiprotein complex called the Ubi metabolon, that contains five enzymes and two accessory proteins, UbiJ and UbiK. The SCP2 domain of UbiJ was proposed to bind the hydrophobic polyisoprenoid tail of UQ biosynthetic intermediates in the Ubi metabolon. How the newly synthesised UQ might be released in the membrane is currently unknown. In this paper, we focused on better understanding the role of the UbiJ-UbiK2 heterotrimer forming part of the metabolon. Given the difficulties to gain functional insights using biophysical techniques, we applied a multiscale molecular modelling approach to study the UbiJ-UbiK2 heterotrimer. Our data show that UbiJ-UbiK2 interacts closely with the membrane and suggests possible pathways to enable the release of UQ into the membrane. This study highlights the UbiJ-UbiK2 complex as the likely interface between the membrane and the enzymes of the Ubi metabolon and supports that the heterotrimer is key to the biosynthesis of UQ8 and its release into the membrane of E. coli.},
