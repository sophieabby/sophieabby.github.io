I am a co-investigator of the ["Origin of Life" consortium](https://origin-life.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble that gathers chemists, biologists and astronomers.
I am a member of the [French Astrobiology society](https://www.exobiologie.fr/). Their website is full of interesting content (in French though).




This project is funded by the IDEX of the Grenoble Alpes University.
