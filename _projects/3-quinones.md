We study the origins and diversification of metabolic pathways involved in bioenergetics using phylogenomics and experimental approaches.

We investigate in particular, the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways of quinones (find our recent [review here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.148259)). Quinones are molecules involved in electron transfer chains. They are therefore crucial for cellular energy production.

We combine experimental and computational approaches. This goes from genome annotation for the proteins involved in the pathways, to the study of their functional diversification, and *in vivo* testing of their predicted functions. Team members also recently characterized [a new pathway for ubiquinone production](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mBio.01319-19), which is O~2~ independent (contrary to the classical, 0~2~-dependent one).

This project is mainly funded by the French National Research Agency, "ANR".
