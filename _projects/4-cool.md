I am a co-investigator of the ["Origin of Life" consortium](https://origin-life.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble that gathers chemists, biologists and astronomers. We investigate the conditions of inhabitable planetary formations, and the transition from chemistry to biology, including early evolution. 

I am a member of the [French Astrobiology society](https://www.exobiologie.fr/) and their website is full of interesting content! Also, a website was started to promote [education on Astrobiology](https://astrobioeducation.org/fr/) (in French).

This project is funded by the IDEX of the Grenoble Alpes University.
