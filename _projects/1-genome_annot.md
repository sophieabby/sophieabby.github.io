We develop software and methods to improve genome annotations.

# MacSyFinder, the macromolecular system finder

In particular we developed [MacSyFinder](https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder), a software to:
  - 1. **model** molecular systems (pathways, machineries...) in microbial genomes
  - 2. **annotate** them in genomes

MacSyFinder takes advantage of the genomic organization by function of archaeal and bacterial genomes: genes participating in a same function, complex, pathway...
tend to co-localize on the genome. This enables powerful, system-level (instead of gene-by-gene) annotation of functions.

For more details, have a look at the corresponding publications:



# MacsyModels, an organization for sharing MacSyFinder models

Since MacSyFinder version 2, it is possible to easily download, install and shared publicly available MacSyFinder models.
This is done from the [official MacSy-models organization](https://github.com/macsy-models). 
Several are readily available, as [described in this paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.02.506364), reviewed and [recommended by PCI Genomics](https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.genomics.100233).

As of Mar 2023, Macsy Models include the detection of:
  - CRISPR-Cas systems
  - bacterial protein secretion systems
  - type IV-filament super-family members
  - conjugative systems
