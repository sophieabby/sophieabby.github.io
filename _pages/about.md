I am a CNRS researcher in Grenoble, France. I work at the [TIMC lab](https://www.timc.fr/en/) as part of the [TrEE team](https://www.timc.fr/en/tree). 

With my colleague Nelle Varoquaux, we manage the **Computational Biology group** [CompBio@TrEE](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio/):

About my research
------

I am a computational microbiologist. I am interested in the mechanisms responsible for the diversity of bacteria and archaea. I study these by analysing sequence data (proteins, genomes) at different scales:
from individual enzyme-level, to molecular pathways and cellular machineries level. To this end, I develop, or use existing tools for comparative genomics, phylogenomics and molecular evolution.
